# Contents

This crate is a collection of common algorithms used in data science written in pure rust.
It includes modules for
 - Fourier analysis
 - Special function evaluations
 - Inter- (and extra)polation
 - Linear algebra
 - Optimization
 - Root finding
 - Sorting
 - Vector math

I only wrote them for educational purposes, so I give no guarantees for correctness or usefulness.
I added links to references where you can learn more about each algorithm where applicable.
Feel free to browse and copy paste things if you are interested in learning more about these algorithms.
